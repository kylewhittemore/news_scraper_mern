# news_scraper_mern
A MERN stack implementation of a simple news scraper
The source scraped was The Hacker Noon webpage

# Technology used:
Implemented the full MERN stack: Mongoose, Express, React, Node
react-bootstrap npm package for UI
puppeteer npm package to allow the scraping of a Js rendered website

# Goals:
To focus on React and Mongoose
Implement a polished and clean but minimal UI 

# Future Improvements:
The delete comment route was added to the API, but I would like to finish the App by allowing the user to delete comments as well

Implement a "clear saved data" function so that the user (or developer) can re-scrape and remove any deletions, comments or favorites.

Implement multiple users so that they can personalize their own article list

Implement pagination of the article list to avoid loading more than a certain number of articles
